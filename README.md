# basic-redis

The task involving setting up a Basic Redis API too handle GET & SET requests.

the project is in NodeJS and connects to a cloud Redis/Redis Enterprise cluster. (Connected after testing locally and installing Ubuntu)

node modules left out of the commit.

(in any other production build obviously i'd be using ENV variables for the keys but i'll possibly be deleting this cluster soon)
